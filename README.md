# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship-Task-1

Scrape data from the web
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should
use a website called Skytrax ( https://www.airlinequality.com/)
The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself.
You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your
analysis. To get started with the data collection, you can use the “Jupyter
Notebook” in the Resources folder to run some Python code that will help to
collect some data.
Analyze data
Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy
and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare
the data for analysis. When the data is clean, you should perform your own
analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic
modeling, sentiment analysis or word clouds to provide some insight into the
content of the reviews. It is recommended to complete this task using Python,
however, you can use any tool that you wish. You can use some of the
documentation websites provided in the Resources folder to analyze the data.
Please ensure that you have created a folder called "data" and mapped your file
path.
Present insights
Your manager would like you to summarize your findings within a single
PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting.
You should create visualizations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as
clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from your
analysis. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided to complete the slide.
After Completing your PowerPoint, You need to submit your document .
